# Exercise_sorting

This repository stands for sorting out teams of students. This is an exercise to deal with C++ and datastructures.

## How does it work?

The main program contains 8 teams. At the beginning, no students are sort out in the team yet. Once the user sorts the students out randomly, they are assigned among the teams.

You just have to run `start.sh` to run the program. It works on both Windows and macOS.
