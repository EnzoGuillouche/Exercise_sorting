# Exercise_sorting

This repository stands for sorting out teams of students. This is an exercise to deal with C++ and datastructures.
It works on both Windows and macOS.

## How does it work?

The main program contains 8 teams. At the beginning, no students are sort out in the team yet. Once the user sorts the students out randomly, they are assigned among the teams.

You just have to run the appropriate file to run the program, depending on your platform:

On macOS:

`./start.sh`

On Windows:

`start.cmd`

It will compile and then execute the compiled program.
